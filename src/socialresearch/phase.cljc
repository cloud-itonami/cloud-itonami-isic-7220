  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout -- the social-sciences-and-humanities
  research analog of `cloud-itonami-isic-7210`'s `research.phase`.

    Phase 0  read-only        -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-intake  -- study intake allowed, every write
                                 needs human approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-verify  -- adds protocol verification + data-
                                 reproducibility-risk screening +
                                 human-subjects-review screening
                                 writes, still approval.
    Phase 3  supervised auto  -- governor-clean, high-confidence
                                 `:study/intake` (no capital risk yet)
                                 may auto-commit. `:actuation/
                                 publish-findings-report` NEVER auto-
                                 commits, at any phase.

  `:actuation/publish-findings-report` is deliberately ABSENT from
  every phase's `:auto` set, including phase 3 -- a permanent
  structural fact, not a rollout milestone still to come. Publishing/
  submitting a real findings report is the ONE real-world research act
  this actor performs; it is always a human research-operator call.
  `socialresearch.governor`'s `:actuation/publish-findings-report`
  high-stakes gate enforces the same invariant independently -- two
  layers, not one, agree on this. `:risk/screen` and `:ethics/screen`
  are likewise never auto-eligible, at any phase -- the same posture
  every sibling's screening op has. Phase 3's `:auto` set here has only
  ONE member (`:study/intake`) -- this domain has no separate no-
  capital-risk 'file' lifecycle distinct from the study record
  itself.")
