(ns socialresearch.registry
  "Pure-function findings-report-publication record construction -- an
  append-only research-lab book-of-record draft, the social-sciences-
  and-humanities analog of `cloud-itonami-isic-7210`'s `research.
  registry`.

  Like every sibling actor's registry, there is no single
  international check-digit standard for a findings-report reference
  number -- every research lab/jurisdiction assigns its own reference
  format. This namespace does NOT invent one; it builds a
  jurisdiction-scoped sequence number and validates the record's
  required fields, the same honest, non-fabricating discipline
  `socialresearch.facts` uses.

  `replication-count-insufficient?` is an HONEST, LITERAL reuse of
  `research.registry`'s own SEVENTH-instance MINIMUM-threshold
  sufficiency check (`veterinary.registry/withdrawal-period-
  insufficient?`/`funeral.registry/waiting-period-elapsed?`/`hospital.
  registry/observation-period-elapsed?` established the first three,
  all TEMPORAL; `association.registry/continuing-education-hours-
  insufficient?` the fourth, non-temporal; `secondary.registry/
  attendance-hours-insufficient?` the fifth; `polling.registry/sample-
  size-insufficient?` the sixth; `research.registry/replication-count-
  insufficient?` the seventh) -- NOT claimed as new. Quantitative
  social-science research (surveys redone across independent samples,
  experimental/quasi-experimental designs) has the SAME replication
  concern as natural-science/engineering experiments, so the same
  minimum-floor comparison applies unchanged: a study's own actual
  replication count against its own recorded minimum-required
  replication count.

  This namespace is pure data + pure functions -- no I/O, no network
  call to any real lab-notebook/instrument system. It builds the
  RECORD a research lab would keep, not the act of publishing the
  findings report itself (that is `socialresearch.operation`'s
  `:actuation/publish-findings-report`, always human-gated -- see
  README `Actuation`)."
