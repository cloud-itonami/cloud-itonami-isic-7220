(ns socialresearch.store
  "SSoT for the social-sciences-and-humanities research actor, behind a
  `Store` protocol so the backend is a swap, not a rewrite -- the same
  seam every prior `cloud-itonami-isic-*` actor in this fleet uses,
  closely modeled on `cloud-itonami-isic-7210`'s `research.store`:

    - `MemStore`     -- atom of EDN. The deterministic default for
                        dev/tests/demo (no deps).
    - `DatomicStore` -- backed by `langchain.db`, a Datomic-API-compatible
                        EAV store (datalog q / pull / upsert). Pure `.cljc`,
                        so it runs offline AND can be pointed at a real
                        Datomic Local or a kotoba-server pod by swapping
                        `langchain.db`'s `:db-api` (see langchain.kotoba-db).

  Both implement the same protocol and pass the same contract
  (test/socialresearch/store_contract_test.clj), which is the whole
  point: the actor, the Research Integrity Governor and the audit
  ledger never know which SSoT they run on.

  Like `research`/7210, this actor has ONE actuation event (publishing/
  submitting a real findings report) acting on a `study` entity, with
  its OWN history collection, sequence counter and dedicated double-
  actuation-guard boolean (`:findings-report-published?`, never a
  `:status` value) -- the same discipline every prior sibling
  governor's guards establish, informed by `cloud-itonami-isic-6492`'s
  status-lifecycle bug (ADR-2607071320).

  Beyond `research.store`'s own `risk-screen-of` (data-reproducibility-
  risk), this store ALSO carries `ethics-screen-of` (human-subjects-
  research-ethics-review status) -- the genuinely new concern this
  vertical adds, since social-science research characteristically
  involves human participants (surveys/interviews/focus groups/
  ethnographic fieldwork) in a way natural-science/engineering R&D
  does not.

  The ledger stays append-only on every backend: 'which study was
  screened for an unresolved data-reproducibility risk or an
  unconfirmed human-subjects-review, which findings report was
  published, on what jurisdictional basis, approved by whom' is always
  a query over an immutable log -- the audit trail the scientific
  community trusting a research lab needs, and the evidence a lab
  needs if a publication decision is later disputed."
